# COMM 4190 - Health Campaign Assignment: Anti-Vaping Campaign using ChatGPT

This repository consists the files and the data utilized to develop a Anti-Vaping Campaign using ChatGPT.

## Overview

Firstly, for the topic of our Health Campaign Messages assignment, we decided to choose vaping as the main topic. According to an article from the Texas Department of Health Services, vaping can be characterized as the act of utilizing battery-powered devices to inhale vapor in a process that simulates conventional smoking. Most recent versions of vapes have the size and appearance of small pods or USB flash drives, and the substance that, when heated, produces the vapor can contain different flavors, and the addition of nicotine or even cannabinoids. Generally, vapes are composed of the battery, which is often rechargeable, sensors to activate the device, the atomizer, which is a coil that heats the liquid substance, and the cartridge that contains the substance.

Electronic cigarettes in the past were not nearly as close as used as they are nowadays. In fact, the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC) estimates that in between 2017 and 2018, the use of vapes amongst students has increased 78%. Additionally, according to ChatGPT itself, reportedly 20% of American students vape regularly, and when we include the amount of non-regular users, numbers can reach up to 40%. The rapid increase in the number of users is still a doubt for health organizations and hospitals. However, the popularity that vapes acquired is often attributed to their discreet appearance and small size, as well as the availability of vapes in multiple colors and flavors, which probably prompted users to try variations of such devices and bring them wherever they go. 

The main problem with the recent increase in the popularity of vapes is that they are notoriously extremely detrimental to one’s health, which turned vapes into a national health problem. Even though scientists are still working to indeed prove the harms that vaping can cause, studies performed by the National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute already demonstrate a close correlation of the use of vapes to several lung and nicotine-related diseases. For instance, after analyzing a sample of 21.000 individuals who vaped regularly, it was possible to identify a vast presence of disease that included asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Also, according to the CDC, the use of vapes that contain nicotine, especially amongst younger individuals, can harm prejudice and affect parts of the brain that control attention, learning, and other pivotal skills, mainly because of how nicotine affects the establishment of synapses in our brains. 

Therefore, considering the popularity that vapes have nowadays and the truly detrimental effects on the human body, we thought that it would be an interesting idea to focus our project on developing a health campaign aimed at diminishing the use of vapes. Additionally, considering our current situation as university students and the fact that college students are amongst the individuals that vape the most, at least in the US, we decided to establish as the campaign focus the University of Pennsylvania and its undergraduate students and graduate students.
