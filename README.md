# COMM 4190 - Health Campaign Assignment: Anti-Vaping Campaign using ChatGPT

This repository consists the files and the data utilized to develop a Anti-Vaping Campaign using ChatGPT.

## Overview

Firstly, for the topic of our Health Campaign Messages assignment, we decided to choose vaping as the main topic. According to an article from the Texas Department of Health Services, vaping can be characterized as the act of utilizing battery-powered devices to inhale vapor in a process that simulates conventional smoking. Most recent versions of vapes have the size and appearance of small pods or USB flash drives, and the substance that, when heated, produces the vapor can contain different flavors, and the addition of nicotine or even cannabinoids. Generally, vapes are composed of the battery, which is often rechargeable, sensors to activate the device, the atomizer, which is a coil that heats the liquid substance, and the cartridge that contains the substance.

Electronic cigarettes in the past were not nearly as close as used as they are nowadays. In fact, the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC) estimates that in between 2017 and 2018, the use of vapes amongst students has increased 78%. Additionally, according to ChatGPT itself, reportedly 20% of American students vape regularly, and when we include the amount of non-regular users, numbers can reach up to 40%. The rapid increase in the number of users is still a doubt for health organizations and hospitals. However, the popularity that vapes acquired is often attributed to their discreet appearance and small size, as well as the availability of vapes in multiple colors and flavors, which probably prompted users to try variations of such devices and bring them wherever they go. 

The main problem with the recent increase in the popularity of vapes is that they are notoriously extremely detrimental to one’s health, which turned vapes into a national health problem. Even though scientists are still working to indeed prove the harms that vaping can cause, studies performed by the National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute already demonstrate a close correlation of the use of vapes to several lung and nicotine-related diseases. For instance, after analyzing a sample of 21.000 individuals who vaped regularly, it was possible to identify a vast presence of disease that included asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Also, according to the CDC, the use of vapes that contain nicotine, especially amongst younger individuals, can harm prejudice and affect parts of the brain that control attention, learning, and other pivotal skills, mainly because of how nicotine affects the establishment of synapses in our brains. 

Therefore, considering the popularity that vapes have nowadays and the truly detrimental effects on the human body, we thought that it would be an interesting idea to focus our project on developing a health campaign aimed at diminishing the use of vapes. Additionally, considering our current situation as university students and the fact that college students are amongst the individuals that vape the most, at least in the US, we decided to establish as the campaign focus the University of Pennsylvania and its undergraduate students and graduate students.

## Important Points 

In order to clarify how the project was developed, as well as its overall structure, we decided to list the most relevant topics that a reader needs to know to understand the work developed. 

**Health Behavior**

- Vaping/Smoking electronic cigarettes
- We chose vaping as the topic of our project because, amongst our initial ideas, vaping seemed the most ubiquituos one. Also, since we are inserted into a reality where a significant amount of people vape, we thought that the content that we would develop could be employ to assist people that are, like us, college students or simply young people. 

**Target Audience**:

- College students and high school students between 16-25 years old.
- The decision to choose this specific target audience came from the fact that after conducting a brief research on the topic, we were able to identify that this is perhaps the audience that is mostly affected by vaping. Also, we wanted to specificy the population to college and high school students since we fit in one of these categories, and we can attest that within our social and academic circles, vaping is certainly a common practice.

**Generative AI Used**:

- ChatGPT 4.0
- We decide the LLM ChatGPT 4.0 for our project for the main reason that it is currently one of the most powerful LLMs in the market, and also because of the fact that it is able to generate and analyze images, as well as written text, which is crucial for our project idea.

**Communication Concept Utilized**

- Elaboration Likelihood Model
- One of the communication concepts that we used to develop our work was the Elaboration Likelihood Model, also known as ELM within the field of communication. The ELM was initially developed in the in the of the 20th century and its main goal was to provide a way to evaluate how persuasive communication can cause a change in the receiver's attitudes. The model affirms that there are two main route through which persuasive communication act: the central route ad the peripheral route.
The central route is usually employed when the person receiving the message has the ability to think and reason on what he the content that he is absorbing. Thus, whatever change in attitude that it can generate tends to be more enduring and persevere on its person. Meanwhile, the peripheral route is regarded as the one vinculated to the receiver's feelings and spontaneous acts. Once they receive the message, they interpret solely on how the message affected or interfered with its non-rational mind.
Besides from being quite similar to the concept that our mind is divided into 2 systems introduced by Daniel Kahneman, we decided to use ELM in our prompts so that ChatGPT's varies in generating answers that are more and less rational and that affect our route in a different way. In summary, we made sure that the LLM was implementing the concept, and asked for it to focus on different routes according to the message. 

**Messaging Venue/Style**

- Social Media texts/videos.
- Since our target audience is mostly composed by young individuals, we decided to focus the prompts and the project in general on generating and evaluating messages designed to be displayed on social media such as TikTok, Instagram, and X, as well as developing texts that fit the language utilized in such platforms. Also, we decided to on generating short video ideas and asked ChatGPT to develop short scenes or images to represent them on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram Reels. 

**Contrasting Framing**

- Gain vs Loss
- For the main contrasting framing of our project, we decided to choose the Gain vs Loss frame, as we thought that it would be quite interesting to evaluate how ChatGPT would respond to having to generate texts that are framed for loss and gain in terms of vaping. The gain frame emphasizes the benefits of quitting vaping while the loss fram highlights the risks and consequences of continuing to vape. Also, we wanted to see how its safety parameters would affect the generation of texts that might insinuate that vaping can have positive effects on people.
